This program is a simple pratice of the python matplotlib animation function, 
which uses the Discret Fourier Transformation to draw a seires of connected fourier epicycles, 
which approximate the input data points.

To run the program, run the fourier_epicycle.py, which will call the get_points.py and display a plt window for input point.

Left click to input and right click to delect last input, when done, press enter (maximum of 100 input points allowed)

The first plt window will close and another will open, which will display the animated epicycles.
